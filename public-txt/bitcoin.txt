 How to mine bitcoin! (BTC)


First you need to make a Wallet on coin.space

So go to coin.space and it will give a passphrase.

REMEMBER IT, WRITE IT DOWN.



I recommend to go to google keep on your chromebook, it's basically sticky notes


once you have a wallet, you will need a pin so that you can login. remember that too.


Once you made a wallet, click receive. Copy the long number its your wallet address.

Next, go to https://99mining.cloud/index.php?reffid=r6Kpp56Y, or any miner site.


Then paste your wallet address in and your good to go.
